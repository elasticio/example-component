## Actions

### Make Raw Request

This action allows you to execute custom requests using the plain REST API.

#### Configuration Fields

* **Don't throw error on 404 Response** - (optional, boolean): When enabled, treats 404 HTTP responses as non-errors. The default value is `false`.

#### Input Metadata

* **Url** - (string, required): The path of the resource relative to the base URL (the part that comes after `https://example.com/v1/`).
* **Method** - (string, required): The HTTP verb to use in the request. Valid options are `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH`, `DELETE`.
* **Request Body** - (object, optional): The body of the request to send.

#### Output Metadata

* **Status Code** - (number, required): The HTTP status code of the response.
* **HTTP Headers** - (object, required): The HTTP headers of the response.
* **Response Body** - (object, optional): The body of the HTTP response.

### Upsert Object

This action updates an existing object if it is found, or creates a new object if it does not exist.

#### Configuration Fields

* **Object Type** - (dropdown, required): The type of object to upsert. Currently, supported types include:
  * Products
  * Users

#### Input Metadata

* **ID** - (string, optional): The ID of the object to upsert.
and other dynamically-generated fields based on the chosen `Object Type`.

#### Output Metadata

The result object from the upsert action.

### Delete Object

This action looks up a single object using a selected field that uniquely identifies it, and then deletes it.

#### Configuration Fields

* **Object Type** - (string, required): The type of object to delete. Currently, supported types include:
  * Products
  * Users
* **Lookup Criteria** - (dropdown, required): A list of object parameters that can uniquely identify the object in the database.

#### Input Metadata

* **Lookup Criteria Value** - (string, required): The value for the unique search criteria specified in the `Lookup Criteria` configuration field.

#### Output Metadata

An object with the result of the deletion.

### Lookup Objects (plural)

This action looks up a set of objects based on defined criteria.

#### Configuration Fields

* **Object Type** - (dropdown, required): The type of object to lookup. Currently, supported types include:
  * Products
  * Users
* **Emit Behavior** - (dropdown, required): Defines how the resulting objects will be emitted. Valid options include `Emit all`, `Emit page`, or `Emit individually`.
* **Number of search terms** - (number, optional): The number of search terms to specify. Valid values are positive integers between 1 and 99, or 0.

#### Input Metadata

The input metadata depends on the value of the configuration field `Number of search terms`.
  * If `Number of search terms` is empty or equals `0`, additional fields will not be generated.
  * If `Number of search terms = 1`, one search term will be added to the metadata.
  * If `Number of search terms > 1`, the number of search terms will equal `Number of search terms`, and the number of criteria links will equal `Number of search terms - 1`.

Each search term has 3 fields:
* **Field Name** - The name of the object field to search on.
* **Condition** - The condition to apply to the selected field.
* **Field Value** - The value to use for the selected field.

The links between conditions can have one of the following values: `AND`, `OR`, to combine several search terms.

#### Output Metadata

* For `Emit All` and `Emit Page` modes: An object with a key `results` that contains an array of objects.
* For `Emit Individually` mode: Each object fills the entire message.
