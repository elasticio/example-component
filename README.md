## Description

This is an example component with implementations of actions and triggers based off of the [Open Integration Hub (OIH) Standard](https://github.com/elasticio/Connectors/blob/master/Adapters/AdapterBehaviorStandardization/StandardizedActionsAndTriggers.md). In addition to the information provided in this standard and the [elastic.io documentation](https://docs.elastic.io/), the code in this repository is filled with comments explaining how actions, triggers, and other elements of an elastic.io integration component work.
